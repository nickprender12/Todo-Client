## About

This is a todo list application I build to learn React, nodeJS, and MongoDB. It is a work in progress and was my first time using a mongoDB NoSQL database. It was also my first time trying to implement user administration and password encryption and validation
## Tech

- Frontend: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">`React`</a> with Hooks and Context Api
- Styling: <a href="https://material-ui.com/">`Material-UI`</a>
- Backend: <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">`Express`</a>
- Database: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">`MongoDB Atlas`</a>
- Testing: <a href="https://jestjs.io/">`Jest`</a>

## Things Working

- __Styling:__ I used the material-ui library for the first time to style the application.

- __User Administration:__ ...

- __MongoDB:__ ...

## Todo

All the things I would Like to add to this project.

- [ ] Clean up component state through use of composition and `prop.children` to avoid over using the context api.

- [ ] A more responsive styling to application.

- [ ] Create a custom theme for styling.
